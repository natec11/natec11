                <img class="headshot-image" src="images/headshot.jpg" />
                <p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Natalie Chu, and I am working towards
                    getting my PhD in Criminology. My research focuses on cybercrime,
                    more specifically on improving how cybercrime can be detected, investigated,
                    and prevented. I created this website to document my journey as I learn more
                    about the Criminology field and work towards establishing my research identity
                    and expertise within cybercrime.
                </p>
                <p>Some background, I studied business for my undergraduate and master’s degrees.
                    The Criminology field represents a new direction for expanding upon my work
                    and research. Because of my background, I will definitely be making references
                    to my business education and in particular the Accounting and Management Information
                    Systems fields. I am keen to uncover overlapping topics between
                    Accounting, MIS, and cybercrime.
                </p>
                <p>When you make your way to my website’s navigation bar you will notice three
                    links: 1) Home (which is this page), 2) Criminology, and 3) Projects. The Criminology link will
                    direct you to all my Criminology related content,
                    which represents everything that I have been learning about relating to
                    Criminology. Additionally, the Projects link will direct you to all of my content about
                    my research and projects that I have been working on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my website's bottom navigation bar, I linked my social media, so feel free to
                    connect with me on these platforms! If you click on Contact Me, you will see a form that I set up
                    that will send me an email when you submit it. I don't anticipate getting an influx of contect
                    requests,
                    but I decided to try and set one up mostly as a learning exercise (more on this in my Projects
                    section). I will also be publishing my code on GitHub, so check that out if you
                    are interested in the development side of this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started this website right at the beginning of my exploration of the
                    Criminology field, and I am very excited to see where this journey takes me.
                    Many people have told me that there is no shortage of ideas and interest in
                    cybercrime, and I can’t wait to share more about everything I discover. I
                    invite you to make your way to the navigation bar at the top of this page and come along with me on
                    my journey to becoming a Criminology academic!
